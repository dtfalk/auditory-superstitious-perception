Hi all! Here is a little explainer for running the Experiment

1) Opening the folder in vs code.
    i imagine you have the folder open in vs code right now... but if somehow you dont, then here is how you do it...
    1) Open VS Code
    2) If the "auditory-superstitious-perception" folder is not already open, the click "File" in the top left and then "Open Folder...".
    3) Select the "auditory-superstitious-perception" from the Desktop
    4) Great! The folder with all of its files should now be open in VS Code. As a sanity check, you should see this files, and a bunch of other files including "runExperiment.py" on the left side of the VS Code window.

2) Activating the virtual environment
    This contains all of our packages for running the code. This NEEDS to be activated before doing step 3 and running the code
    1) If a VS Code terminal did not automatically open (it typically opens in the bottom of the VS Code window, and you will see something like "PS C:\Users\Apex\Desktop\auditory-superstitious-perception>"), then click on the "Terminal" drop down menu on the top of the VS Code window and then select "New Terminal". It should open a terminal for you.
    2) Type "./venv/scripts/activate" into the terminal and press enter. Make sure to ONLY COPY THE STUFF IN BETWEEN THE QUOTATION MARKS AND DO NOT INCLUDE THE QUOTATION MARKS. You can copy paste from this document and paste in the terminal and then press enter if you would like. After doing this you should see a green "(venv)" to the left of the "PS C:\Users\Apex\Desktop\auditory-superstitious-perception>".
    3) Great! The environment is activated.

3) Running the code
    1) Type "python runExperiment.py" into the terminal and press enter. The code should now be running! If it doesn't pop up, sometimes you have to click the python icon in the bottom right of the taskbar in the bottom middle of the screen and then it will pop up.
